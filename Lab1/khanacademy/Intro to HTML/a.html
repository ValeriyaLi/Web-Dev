    <h1>This Beautiful Planet</h1>
    <p>Please tell me that I was a good child <br>
And that I did everything right<br>
And that the atmosphere was exactly certain<br>
I want you to love me<br>
In ways that you never have<br>
So that I become a forgotten world<br>
With rainbow sunrises over dark green trees<br>
And the cooling of the day<br>
Becomes normal again<br>
We will sit and watch the body of water<br>
That we once called a sort of death<br>
You know even in my dreams<br>
You say I’ll never get it right<br>
This is not a dream<br>
We are burning here with no escape<br>
But no matter how many times<br>
They talk about the moon<br>
It does not take a poet<br>
To know that the moon<br>
Is still only an illusion<br>
Only an illusion<br>
The moon calls out to all of us<br>
Come back, it says<br>
But we don’t hear it<br>
Already on our way<br>
To somewhere<br>
